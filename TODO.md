## Best pokedex by far
- [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex)
- [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/)
- [PokemonShowdown](https://dex.pokemonshowdown.com/pokemon/)

## Fetching 
- implement indexedDB cache, or simply use [Pokeapi Js Wrapper](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper)
- [Lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading)
- [Speculative loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Speculative_loading)
- [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) might be useful for lazy loading
- [Critical rendering path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path)
